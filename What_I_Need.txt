Project: Library Management System

Description: 
This project will simulate a library management system, where users can borrow and return books. 
The system will have multiple classes, including a Book class, a User class, and a Library class. 
The Book class will contain information about each book, such as title, author, and publication year. 
The User class will contain information about each user, such as name, email, and borrowed books. 
The Library class will contain information about the available books and manage the borrowing and returning process.

Here's a basic outline of the classes and their methods:

    - init(self, title, author, year): initializes the Book object with the given title, author, and publication year

    - get_name(self): returns the name of the user
    - get_email(self): returns the email of the user
    - borrow_book(self, book): allows the user to borrow a book by adding it to their borrowed books list
